## Getting Started

populate .env.local with the variables from .env.format on the root of the project

- @'gain solutions', I will email the .env.local file, alongside the link to this repo

After the previous step is done :

install the dependecies

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Or, to use the production version, I hosted it on vercel.
