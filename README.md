## Getting Started

place the .env.local file at the root of the project

- @'gain solutions', I Have emailed .env.local file, alongside the link to this repo and the production url

After the previous step is done :

install the dependecies

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Or, to use the production version, I hosted it on vercel.
